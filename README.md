The source code and datasets for paperï¼š

Muhan Zhang, Zhicheng Cui, Tolutola Oyetunde, Yinjie Tang, Yixin Chen. Recovering Metabolic Networks using A Novel Hyperlink Prediction Method. arXiv:1610.06941.

Please first install libFM, which can be downloaded from http://www.libfm.org. Then copy the "bin/libFM" file into "HyperLinkPrediction/data/" to replace the original one.

Run Meta_RecoverS.m in MATLAB for doing the metabolic reaction prediction experiments.

For a bioinformatics-specific version of code, please refer to https://github.com/Tolutola/BoostGAPFILL#boostgapfill. And the paper is:
